Breakdown of scripts

generate_canonical.py
 - pulls from spacewalk-remote-utils.noarch as a canonical 
   list from upstream
 - pulls from koji.gooselinux.org for a specified tag as a 
   canonical list for GoOSe
 - sorts both lists and writes each to a text file

compare_pkgs_with_upstream.py
 - loads the two files generated above and a known list of 
   changes. Compares the two files and returns 
   the following results for each architecture:
   - which packages are in upstream but not GoOSe (missing)
   - which packages have been altered from upstream (altered)
   - all other packages (remaining)

gather_data.py (will be renamed to generate_rpm_data.py)
 - pulls down RPMS from each of the lists above as appropriate
 - generates a page for each RPM with the following:
   - name, summary and sha256sum of the rpm itself
   - the equivalent of rpm -qp --dump RPM - which generates a 
     list of each file and its useful values
   - for each binary in the rpm, perform an ldd dump
